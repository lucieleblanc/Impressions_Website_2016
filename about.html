		<p>MHS Impressions is an innovative, student-directed photography magazine, designed to be a creative platform where MHS students can share their photograhy with the school and the communty. Impressions runs almost completely on phtotgraphy submissions fronm the student body, which are then critiqued by the school's photo club and put in the magazine if approved by a select group of MHS Impressions editors. This process is what truly separates Impressions from other publications in that the submissions process allows students to obtain feedback on the work that they are proud of, and, in turn, makes them better artists and thinkers. </p>
